Recently while explaining workflow of an application at work, I wasn't able to explain AutoMapper and Profiles to a team member, instead of saying "just follow the pattern" I digged deeper and set up some more details examples. Obviously, this isn't 100% how auto mapper must be used in Enterprise project but provide some basic learning on how to use the AutoMapper.
