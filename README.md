# AutoMapperExample
 This is Example for using Automapper

## Description
Recently while explaining workflow of an application at work, I wasn't able to explain AutoMapper and Profiles to a team member, instead of saying "just follow the pattern" I digged deeper and set up some more details examples. Obviously, this isn't 100% how auto mapper must be used in Enterprise project but provide some basic learning on how to use the AutoMapper.
<br/><br/>

## Behaviour
It is a simple console program that uses automapper
<br/>

The application use simple object mapping where aource and destination have same name. 

Example is explain using Profiles and Projections when destination and source doesn't have identical propert names and may contain complex object.

<br/>
The next progression from here is using DI for IMapper provided by Microsoft framework.
